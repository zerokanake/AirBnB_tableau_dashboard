# AirBnB Tableau Dashboard

## Introduction
This project leverages AirBnB data sourced from Kaggle to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing and visualizing key metrics. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I performed in-depth data exploration to recognize patterns and extract valuable insights. The dashboard highlights variations in price per bedroom, location, property type, and revenue per year through dynamic plots and charts. The goal of this project was to turn raw data into actionable insights, showcasing my ability to analyze complex datasets and present findings effectively. 

## Project Description

This project involves analyzing AirBnB listing data to gain insights into:

- **Pricing trends**: Understanding how prices vary by location, property type, and seasonality.
- **Occupancy rates**: Identifying factors that influence occupancy rates across different regions.

The insights are presented through an interactive Tableau dashboard, designed to be intuitive and actionable for stakeholders.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Preprocessed raw data using Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Data Visualization**: Created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to present key insights effectively.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied statistical techniques to uncover patterns and correlations in the data.
- **Storytelling with Data**: Translated complex analyses into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Tableau**: For creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards.
- **Excel**: For transforming data, data wrangling and validation.
